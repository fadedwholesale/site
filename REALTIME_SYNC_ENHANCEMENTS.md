## Real-Time Event Flow

### Order Placement Flow:
1. **Partner Portal**: User places order via cart system
2. **Cart System**: Creates comprehensive order with status history
3. **Shared Data Manager**: Saves order to shared storage
4. **Real-Time Sync**: Broadcasts `order_placed` event
5. **Admin Portal**: Receives event via `handleNewOrderInAdmin()`
6. **Admin Portal**: Updates inventory, shows notification, plays sound
7. **Admin Portal**: Logs order receipt via SimpleLogger

### Inventory Update Flow:
1. **Admin Portal**: Admin updates product (price, stock, status)
2. **Shared Data Manager**: Saves changes and broadcasts `product_updated`
3. **Real-Time Sync**: Transmits update across all connected sessions
4. **Partner Portal**: Receives update via real-time listeners
5. **Partner Portal**: Updates product display and shows notification
6. **Both Portals**: Periodic verification ensures consistency
