- **Sync Verification**: Confirms data synchronization between admin and partner portals

## Technical Implementation

### Logger Status Indicator
```html
<div id="loggerStatus" class="sync-status">
    <span>ðŸ“Š</span>
    <span id="loggerStatusText">Logger Active</span>
</div>
```

### Key Functions Added
- `updateLoggerStatus()`: Updates UI status indicator
- `testSystemCommunication()`: Verifies system connectivity
